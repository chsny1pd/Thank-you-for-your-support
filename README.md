## 📘 Overview

This project simulates an **Order Management System** that stores data in a CSV file.  
Users can **add, read, search, update, and delete orders**, with data validation (date, product, and order ID checks).

Additionally, it includes:
- ✅ Unit Tests for `Add`, `Update`, and `Delete` operations  
- ✅ End-to-End (E2E) Test for verifying full workflow  
- ✅ Interactive menu interface in the main program  

All data is stored in a local file: `orders.csv`
